## Introduction

The original chart visualizing the Global Terrorism Index lacked clarity in terms of trends and country comparisons across time. Our objective is to improve interpretability while preserving the integrity of the data.

## Original Visualization

**Critique**:
  
- ❌ Hard to distinguish year-on-year trends
  
- ❌ Poor use of color gradients
  
- ✅ Includes core metrics: Score, Rank, etc.

## Data Preparation

We used the *Global Terrorism Index 2023.xlsx* file from the Institute for Economics and Peace. The `Overall Scores` sheet was selected due to its completeness and structured format.

```{r}

library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Load the data
df <- read_excel("data/Global Terrorism Index 2023.xlsx", sheet = "Overall Scores")

# Convert to long format
long_df <- df %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = matches("^[0-9]{4} Score$"), names_to = "Year", values_to = "Score") %>%
  mutate(Year = as.integer(gsub(" Score", "", Year)))

# Filter top 15 countries based on latest score
top15 <- df %>%
  select(Country, `2022 Score`) %>%
  arrange(desc(`2022 Score`)) %>%
  slice(1:15) %>%
  pull(Country)

filtered_df <- long_df %>%
  filter(Country %in% top15)

# Plot the data
ggplot(filtered_df, aes(x = Year, y = Score, color = Country)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +   # ← updated here
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Top 15 Countries by Terrorism Index Score (2012–2022)",
       y = "GTI Score",
       x = "Year",
       color = "Country") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),
        legend.position = "bottom",
        legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"))

```

## GTI Score vs. Fatalities (2022) [Another Example]

To assess how well the GTI score reflects actual impact, we visualized the relationship between the 2022 score and the number of fatalities from terrorist incidents.

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Load 2022 data
data_2022 <- read_excel("data/Global Terrorism Index 2023.xlsx", sheet = "2022")

# Clean column names if necessary
colnames(data_2022) <- make.names(colnames(data_2022))

# Filter out missing values
data_clean <- data_2022 %>%
  filter(!is.na(Score) & !is.na(Fatalities))

# Create scatter plot
ggplot(data_clean, aes(x = Score, y = Fatalities, label = Country)) +
  geom_point(color = "tomato", size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_text(size = 3, hjust = 1.1, check_overlap = TRUE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "GTI Score vs. Fatalities in 2022",
       x = "GTI Score",
       y = "Number of Fatalities",
       caption = "Data source: Institute for Economics and Peace") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"))

```

Insight:
  
- There is a general positive relationship between GTI Score and fatalities.
  
- Some countries have high scores but relatively fewer fatalities, suggesting score includes other risk factors (e.g., fear, threat perception, policy).
